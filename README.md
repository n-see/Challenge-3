our Project must be using GitHub and you need to make sure each person has their own branch. Also be sure to include your Git Hub Link.

This is a group project, so you will submit a 1 page peer review for each of your group mates. You will also write a 1 page self-reflection on how you think you did.

Your Project must be fully responsive and each member of the team must submit the entire project.

Peer Review Comment: Neo, Sam, and Alicia did a great job. All pages are responsive and look good. Liked the choice of getting rid of the banner picture on the index page to make it look better. Some fonts are smaller on bigger screens, but look fine on normal screen sizes. Overall very high quality website with the best responsiveness on all pages.
